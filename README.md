This project started out as a proof-of-concept for a potential employer.
They chose not to hire me, but I continued coding and here is the end-result.


The STL parser is mine, the display code is modified from an Away3D tutorial at http://www.flashmagazine.com/

Changes made to the display code from the tutorial: It was changed to display ANY geometry (the tutorial displays a cube)

You can parse STL files of all complexities (both binary and ASCII). The display is pretty good for simpler files like those in the examples section.

The file you want to see is STLViewer.as, it has everything you'll need.

You're welcome to use it, improve upon it, as long as you contribute somthing back to the project.
One condition, however is that you may NOT use it in commercial projects without clearly VISIBLE attribution to "Pranav Hosangadi http://github.com/pranavh"
